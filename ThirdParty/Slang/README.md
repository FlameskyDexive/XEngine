# XEngine.Slang

A .NET wrapper over the [Slang](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang) shader compiler. Supports nearly all of Slang's native COM API and all of the shader reflection and type API.

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/XEngine.Slang.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/XEngine.Slang)

## Features

- **Near-Complete Slang Support**
  - Nearly all of Slang's API is exposed to C# through a memory-safe and garbage collected proxy.
  - No need to track references or dispose of native Slang objects--the library handles it automatically using COM reference tracking and C# finalizers.

- **C# Language Conventions**
  - Native Slang methods which use C++-style parameters or type conventions are replaced.
  - Getters in reflection API have been replaced with C# properties (.GetFoo() -> .Foo)
  - No exposed native pointers or custom datatypes--wrapper uses C# datatypes as much as possible.
  - SlangResult has been replaced with C#-style exceptions to allow better use of the try-catch programming paradigm.
  - Compiler error messages in strings can now be parsed into a `Diagnostic` datatype, to simplify reading error codes, source files, line numbers, and more from C#.

- **Extensive XML Documentation**
  - All of the Slang API has been documented, including parts not originally documented in source Slang.
  - Complete XML documentation coverage, with intellisense for every function and type.

- **Cross Platform**
  - Supports all 3 major desktop platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
  - Supports 64-bit x86 and ARM instruction sets

## Usage

### Basic Compilation

```csharp
using XEngine.Slang;

// Description for a single platform target output
TargetDescription targetDesc = new()
{
  Format = CompileTarget.Spirv, // Emit vulkan-compatible SPIR-V words
  Profile = GlobalSession.FindProfile("spirv_1_5") // Use SPIR-V 1.5 capabilities
};

// Description for a compilation session
SessionDescription sessionDesc = new()
{
  Targets = [targetDesc], // Only targeting SPIR-V - add more targets to automatically compile for multiple different APIs
  SearchPaths = ["./", "./Shaders"], // Search paths are relative to CWD
};

Session session = GlobalSession.CreateSession(sessionDesc);

// Load file called 'shaders.slang'. If warnings appear during loading, they will be written into `diagnostics`
Module module = session.LoadModule("shaders", out DiagnosticInfo diagnostics);

EntryPoint vertex = module.FindEntryPointByName("vertexMain");
EntryPoint fragment = module.FindEntryPointByName("fragmentMain");

// Create a composite program from the entrypoints. If warnings appear, they will be written into `diagnostics`
ComponentType program = session.CreateCompositeComponentType([module, vertex, fragment], out diagnostics);

// Vertex entrypoint at index 0. If warnings appear during compilation, they will be written into `diagnostics`
Memory<byte> compiledVertex = program.GetEntryPointCode(0, 0, out diagnostics);

// Fragment entrypoint at index 1. If warnings appear during compilation, they will be written into `diagnostics`
Memory<byte> compiledFragment = program.GetEntryPointCode(1, 0, out diagnostics);
```

### Advanced compilation

Examples of advanced compilation which may involve specializing shader types and performing advanced linking/reflection can be found under both the `Samples/` and `Tests/` directories.

## Limitations
  - Native Unsafe API is internal and not exposed. Marshaling and safety checks are non-negotiable for those looking to squeeze out faster performance from the library.
  - API is not completely memory safe. Certain combinations of reflection, specialization, and linker options can still corrupt process memory if used incorrectly.
