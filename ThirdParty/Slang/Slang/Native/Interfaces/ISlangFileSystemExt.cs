/** An extended file system abstraction.

Implementing and using this interface over ISlangFileSystem gives much more control over how
paths are managed, as well as how it is determined if two files 'are the same'.

All paths as input byte*, or output as ISlangBlobs are always encoded as UTF-8 strings.
Blobs that contain strings are always zero terminated.

    /** Get a uniqueIdentity which uniquely identifies an object of the file system.

    Given a path, returns a 'uniqueIdentity' which ideally is the same value for the same object
    on the file system.

    The uniqueIdentity is used to compare if two paths are the same - which amongst other things
    allows Slang to cache source contents internally. It is also used for #pragma once
    functionality.

    A *requirement* is for any implementation is that two paths can only return the same
    uniqueIdentity if the contents of the two files are *identical*. If an implementation breaks
    this constraint it can produce incorrect compilation. If an implementation cannot *strictly*
    identify *the same* files, this will only have an effect on #pragma once behavior.

    The string for the uniqueIdentity is held zero terminated in the ISlangBlob of
    outUniqueIdentity.

    Note that there are many ways a uniqueIdentity may be generated for a file. For example it
    could be the 'canonical path' - assuming it is available and unambiguous for a file system.
    Another possible mechanism could be to store the filename combined with the file date time
    to uniquely identify it.

    The client must ensure the blob be released when no longer used, otherwise memory will leak.

    NOTE! Ideally this method would be called 'getPathUniqueIdentity' but for historical reasons
    and backward compatibility it's name remains with 'File' even though an implementation
    should be made to work with directories too.
